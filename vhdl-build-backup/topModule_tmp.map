Phase 4.2  Initial Clock and IO Placement

......
WARNING:Place:1019 - A clock IOB / clock component pair have been found that are
   not placed at an optimal clock IOB / clock site pair. The clock component
   <clock_BUFGP/BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGMUX_X1Y10>. The IO component
   <clock> is placed at site <B5>.  This will not allow the use of the fast path
   between the IO and the Clock buffer. This is normally an ERROR but the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN <clock.PAD> allowing
   your design to continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules
   related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of this override is highly
   discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended
   that this error condition be corrected in the design.

Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    2
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:           184 out of   1,920    9%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             1,257 out of   1,920   65%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            873 out of     960   90%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     873 out of     873 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     873   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       1,664 out of   1,920   86%
    Number used as logic:             1,233
    Number used as a route-thru:        407
    Number used as Shift registers:      24

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 14 out of      83   16%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     1 out of      24    4%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                1.76

Peak Memory Usage:  679 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  11 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   11 secs
