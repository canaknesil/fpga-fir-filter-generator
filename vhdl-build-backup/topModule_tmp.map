Phase 4.2  Initial Clock and IO Placement

..............
WARNING:Place:1019 - A clock IOB / clock component pair have been found that are
   not placed at an optimal clock IOB / clock site pair. The clock component
   <switch_BUFGP/BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGMUX_X1Y10>. The IO component
   <switch> is placed at site <B5>.  This will not allow the use of the fast
   path between the IO and the Clock buffer. This is normally an ERROR but the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN <switch.PAD>
   allowing your design to continue. This constraint disables all clock placer
   rules related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of this override is highly
   discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended
   that this error condition be corrected in the design.

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    9
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:            33 out of   1,920    1%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:               641 out of   1,920   33%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            493 out of     960   51%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     493 out of     493 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     493   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:         911 out of   1,920   47%
    Number used as logic:               641
    Number used as a route-thru:        270

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 14 out of      83   16%
    IOB Flip Flops:                       1
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     1 out of      24    4%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                1.78
