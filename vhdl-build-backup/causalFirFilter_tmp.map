Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    1
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:           241 out of   1,920   12%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             1,151 out of   1,920   59%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            887 out of     960   92%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     887 out of     887 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     887   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       1,691 out of   1,920   88%
    Number used as logic:             1,151
    Number used as a route-thru:        540

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 17 out of      83   20%
    IOB Flip Flops:                       8
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     1 out of      24    4%
  Number of MULT18X18SIOs:                2 out of       4   50%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                1.46

Peak Memory Usage:  679 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  9 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   9 secs
