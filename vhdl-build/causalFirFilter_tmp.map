Xilinx Map Application Log File for Design 'threesamplefilter'

Design Information
------------------
Command Line   : map -timing -ol high -detail -pr b -register_duplication -w -o
causalFirFilter_tmp.ncd -smartguide smartguide.ncd causalFirFilter.ngd 
Target Device  : xc3s100e
Target Package : cp132
Target Speed   : -5

WARNING:Map:34 - Speed grade not specified.  Using default "-5".
Loading device for application Rf_Device from file '3s100e.nph' in environment
/opt/Xilinx/14.7/ISE_DS/ISE/.
   "threesamplefilter" is an NCD, version 3.2, device xc3s100e, package cp132,
speed -5
WARNING:Map:267 - There will be a smaller percentage of guiding when using
   SmartGuide with the some of the physical synthesis options. These options
   include:
   "Combinatorial Logic Optimization"(-logic_opt),"Global
   Optimization"(-global_opt), and "Register
   Duplication"(-register_duplication).

   The command line used to create the guide file is:
   -timing -ol high -detail -pr b -register_duplication -w -o
   causalFirFilter_tmp.ncd causalFirFilter.ngd 

   The command line used for this run is:
   -timing -ol high -detail -pr b -register_duplication -w -o
   causalFirFilter_tmp.ncd -smartguide smartguide.ncd causalFirFilter.ngd 

   If one or more of the above physical synthesis options is being used,
   SmartGuide will have a lower guide percentage, possibly longer runtimes and
   possibly worse timing scores. If the physical synthesis option is required to
   meet timing, it is suggested that SmartGuide is not used. If the physical
   synthesis option is not required, it is suggested to re-create the guide
   without the physical synthesis option and re-run SmartGuide

ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the
   Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for your design
   exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices
   reported may not be reflected accurately as their packing might not have been
   completed.

Interim Summary
---------------
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:           126 out of   1,920    6%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             2,656 out of   1,920  138% (OVERMAPPED)
Logic Distribution:
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   2,288 out of   2,288 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   2,288   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       3,790 out of   1,920  197% (OVERMAPPED)
    Number used as logic:             2,656
    Number used as a route-thru:      1,134

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 17 out of      83   20%
    IOB Flip Flops:                       1
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     1 out of      24    4%


Mapping completed.
