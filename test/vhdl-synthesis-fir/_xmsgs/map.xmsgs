<msg type="warning" file="Map" num="267" delta="old" >There will be a smaller percentage of guiding when using SmartGuide with the some of the physical synthesis options. These options include:
&quot;Combinatorial Logic Optimization&quot;(-logic_opt),&quot;Global Optimization&quot;(-global_opt), and &quot;Register Duplication&quot;(-register_duplication).

The command line used to create the guide file is:
<arg fmt="%s" index="1">-timing -ol high -detail -pr b -register_duplication -w -o causalFirFilter_tmp.ncd causalFirFilter.ngd </arg>

The command line used for this run is:
<arg fmt="%s" index="2">-timing -ol high -detail -pr b -register_duplication -w -o causalFirFilter_tmp.ncd -smartguide smartguide.ncd causalFirFilter.ngd </arg>

If one or more of the above physical synthesis options is being used, SmartGuide will have a lower guide percentage, possibly longer runtimes and possibly worse timing scores. If the physical synthesis option is required to meet timing, it is suggested that SmartGuide is not used. If the physical synthesis option is not required, it is suggested to re-create the guide without the physical synthesis option and re-run SmartGuide
