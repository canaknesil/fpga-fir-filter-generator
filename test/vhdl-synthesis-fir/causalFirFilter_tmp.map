Xilinx Map Application Log File for Design 'threesamplefilter'

Design Information
------------------
Command Line   : map -timing -ol high -detail -pr b -register_duplication -w -o
causalFirFilter_tmp.ncd -smartguide smartguide.ncd causalFirFilter.ngd 
Target Device  : xc3s100e
Target Package : cp132

WARNING:Map:34 - Speed grade not specified.  Using default "-5".
Loading device for application Rf_Device from file '3s100e.nph' in environment
/opt/Xilinx/14.7/ISE_DS/ISE/.
   "threesamplefilter" is an NCD, version 3.2, device xc3s100e, package cp132,
speed -5
WARNING:Map:267 - There will be a smaller percentage of guiding when using
   SmartGuide with the some of the physical synthesis options. These options
   include:
   "Combinatorial Logic Optimization"(-logic_opt),"Global
   Optimization"(-global_opt), and "Register
   Duplication"(-register_duplication).

   The command line used to create the guide file is:
   -timing -ol high -detail -pr b -register_duplication -w -o
   causalFirFilter_tmp.ncd causalFirFilter.ngd 

   The command line used for this run is:
   -timing -ol high -detail -pr b -register_duplication -w -o
   causalFirFilter_tmp.ncd -smartguide smartguide.ncd causalFirFilter.ngd 

   If one or more of the above physical synthesis options is being used,
   SmartGuide will have a lower guide percentage, possibly longer runtimes and
   possibly worse timing scores. If the physical synthesis option is required to
   meet timing, it is suggested that SmartGuide is not used. If the physical
   synthesis option is not required, it is suggested to re-create the guide
   without the physical synthesis option and re-run SmartGuide

WARNING:Pack:2609 - SmartGuide is more efficient (better guiding and runtime)
   when used with explicit timing constraints. If you want the full benefit of
   the SmartGuide flow, please add timing constraints to your design, then
   re-create your guide file.
