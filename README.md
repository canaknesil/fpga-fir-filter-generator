# FPGA FIR Filter Generator

This project has two parts:

## 1 - Custom FIR Filter VHDL Generator

This part generates VHDL code for a custom FIR filter, synthesizes it, and downloads it to the FPGA board.

## 2 - FPGA FIR Filter Framework for Raspberry Pi

This part enables Raspberry Pi developers to use the configured FPGA with their FIR filter applications.
